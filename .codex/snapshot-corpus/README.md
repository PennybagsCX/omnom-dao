## Snapshot Files

### Ever-Held Master List (Default Lookup)

The **union of all snapshots** — anyone who held OMNOM at any point during the snapshot window. Used for wallet lookups and airdrop eligibility.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| File | `omnom-snapshot-ever-held.csv` |
| Format | Tab-delimited |
| Holders | 25,686 (unique, all-time) |
| Source | Pre-announcement + weekly (Jun 14–Aug 8) + latest merged |
| Columns | `rank`, `address`, `max_balance_raw`, `max_pct`, `best_rank`, `snapshot_count`, `snapshots`, `first_seen` |

**What it captures:**
- Current holders (still hold OMNOM)
- Past holders (held in any snapshot but since sold/transferred)
- Snapshot history per wallet (which weeks they appeared in, peak balance, first seen)

**Who it misses:** MEXC off-chain holdings (users who never transferred to Dogechain on-chain).

### Current Holders (Latest)

The most recent weekly snapshot — holders with non-zero OMNOM balance at the last collection.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| File | `omnom-snapshot-latest.csv` |
| Format | CSV (comma-delimited) |
| Holders | 25,542 |
| Columns | `rank`, `address`, `balance_raw`, `balance_formatted`, `percentage_of_supply` |

Used by the lookup script to determine `CURRENTLY_HOLDS: yes/no`.

### Pre-Announcement Snapshot (Baseline)

## Data Integrity

- `HASHES.json` contains SHA-256 hashes for snapshot files
- Backfill reconciliation: All weekly snapshots achieve >99.99% balance reconciliation (forward-applied transfers match expected supply). Zero negative balances.
- Ever-held merge verified: 25,686 unique holders (25,431 pre-announcement + 255 new from weekly (Jun 14–Aug 8))

---

## Dogechain Shutdown Context

- **Announced:** June 8, 2026 by @DogechainFamily
- **Window:** ~60 days → estimated shutdown ~August 7, 2026
- **Final snapshot:** Week 4 (Jul 5, 2026) + latest (Jul 15, 2026)
- **BlockScout Explorer:** `explorer.dogechain.dog` — status unknown post-shutdown

## Future: OMNOM v2 on DogeOS?

These snapshots preserve the canonical holder list. If OMNOM is redeployed on **DogeOS** (MyDoge's EVM ZK rollup), this data enables:

1. **Airdrop/claim** for verified ever-held wallets
2. **Holder verification** without needing live Dogechain RPC
3. **Historical record** of the original distribution
